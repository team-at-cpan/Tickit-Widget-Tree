Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
	New features:
	* Navigate to parent node via <Left>, first child via <Right> for quicker
	keyboard-only access
	* Calculate real size rather than using placeholder values of 1 line, 1 col,
	allowing widgets such as ScrollBox to work correctly.

	Bug fixes:
	* 'next row' logic would wrap to top of tree rather than stopping at the
	end of the tree
	* "Avoid" (as opposed to "fix") flood of warnings from Tickit::Window->restore

0.090_001 2013-09-11 01:30:30 Europe/London
	NOTE: This is a complete rewrite, and now uses Tree::DAG_Node for most of the
	important parts. Most old methods for navigating the tree have been removed as
	a consequence.

	New features:
	* Tickit::Style support
	* Render lines using Tickit::RenderBuffer
	* Mouse support

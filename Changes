Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
	New features:
	* Cursor is in a slightly less confusing location
	* CAN_SCROLL support (for embedding in Tickit::Widget::ScrollBox)

	Examples:
	* Scrolling example added, requires Tickit::Widget::ScrollBox

	Bug fixes:
	* Sizing was incorrect in the last version - the cols value was
	stored as lines as well :(

0.100     2013-09-13 22:47:38 Europe/London
	Version bump for non-DEV release.

	New features:
	* highlight_node event invoked when the currently-selected node is changed.
	Currently undocumented since the API may change slightly after some more
	testing.

0.090_002 2013-09-13 22:41:34 Europe/London
	New features:
	* Navigate to parent node via <Left>, first child via <Right> for quicker
	keyboard-only access
	* Calculate real size rather than using placeholder values of 1 line, 1 col,
	allowing widgets such as ScrollBox to work correctly.

	Bug fixes:
	* 'next row' logic would wrap to top of tree rather than stopping at the
	end of the tree
	* "Avoid" (as opposed to "fix") flood of warnings from Tickit::Window->restore

0.090_001 2013-09-11 01:30:30 Europe/London
	NOTE: This is a complete rewrite, and now uses Tree::DAG_Node for most of the
	important parts. Most old methods for navigating the tree have been removed as
	a consequence.

	New features:
	* Tickit::Style support
	* Render lines using Tickit::RenderBuffer
	* Mouse support

0.003     2012-01-24 00:20:31 Europe/London
	New features:
	 * Support widget for label rather than plain text
	 * Support different pens for highlight and regular label
	 * Adjust style handling so we have all strings in one place

	Bug fixes:
	 * Resolved some rendering artifacts when opening/closing tree nodes
	 * Fixed some undef warnings

	Backwards compatibility:
	 * Removed the following methods which were used for internal housekeeping:
	   * is_valid_tree_node
